# AI Game/Simulation Persecution

## Pathfinding, Finite state Machine, A*, Heuristic, Field of view (FOV), Line of sight (LOS)

Enemies will patrol through their nodes, if it's not in line of sight he will generate the path to reach the current node in the array.
In case of having the player in his FOV, he will start chasing and will send the position to the other enemies to go to that location and chase him too.
